# Dynomix

It's the wave of the future.

Dynomix is a handy utility for interacting with the Companion module for vMix.

Just open the page, enter your local Companion & vMix instance information, and enjoy easy access to the unique `key` for every input in your currently open project.

## Why?

When programming vMix <-> Companion communication, using each input's unique `key` allows much more stable access to that input. Without a key, Companion matches based on input name (`title`) or number (`number`).
Dynomix also grabs those from vMix, so you always know exactly which input you're grabbing with the one-click copy button.

## Help!

Please open an Issue in [the Dynomix GitHub repository](https://github.com/bost-ty/dynomix/issues). Thanks!
